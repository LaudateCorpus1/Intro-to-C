Write a program that prompts the user for a number
and then prints out a triangle of asterisks ('*')
such that the width and height of the triangle are
equal to the number which the user typed in.

For example, if the user types in 3, then the output
should be:

*
**
***

and if the user types in 7, then the output should be:

*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******

Hints:  
1. Use for loops.
2. Here's how to read in an integer from the user:

	int value;

	scanf("%d", &value);
