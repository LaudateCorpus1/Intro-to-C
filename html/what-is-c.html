<ul>
<li>C is a programming language that is fairly low level and close to the machine
<li>C is especially good for writing Operating Systems or for use on small microprocessors
<li>C is also useful as a general purpose language.
<li>C is a compiled language, not interpreted, and generally compiles
to the native instruction set of the hardware.
<li>C is a good choice when you need your code to be fast and small.
<li>C does not protect you very much from bugs -- easy to shoot yourself in the foot.
<li>C is a procedural language, not an object oriented language, though it is
possible to do some sorta/kinda object-oriented programming in C.
<li>C is a small language.  It's possible to learn the entire language.
